# Automation repository
This is the test automation project, this repository contains scripts and datafiles needed for automation.

## Script, test suites and test cases
Disclaimer : From here on, "script" will refer to what Katalon calls "test case", which is different from the usual meaning of test case.
This is specific to Katalon vocabulary and should not be a reference outside this project.

We drive 'script' using data : the same script given different data will run a different test case.

A test suite is a collection of script.
A test case is a script run given a set of data.
